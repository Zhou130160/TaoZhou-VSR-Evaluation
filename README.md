We need to explain what the uploaded file represents.

The three .pth files represent the three models trained.

The .yml file represents the parameters of the training model.

The .zip file represents the composite video of the frame after super-resolution of the model. 

Compilation environment: It is recommended to use pycharm IDE to compile under window 10.

Environment: It is recommended to use Anaconda to manage an environment, if you have a better choice.

Python function package: If it is the environment that comes with Anaconda, you need to check whether there are numpy, opencv, tkinter and _thread, you may be missing an opencv at most, you can install it directly in Anaconda.
